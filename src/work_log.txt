Work Log
    1. Started running portfolio page on github pages
    2. Started running Butcher Store on GCP with Apache2 server set to run for PHP
    3. Currently adding the link to Butcher Store to the Project page in the porfolio page.

To Do
    * the Butcher Store instance is running on http, which leaves a security concern. Might wanna look into running this in HTTPS in the near future.
    * Butcher Store link reveals the raw external IP endowed by GCP; might wanna change DNS settings later to change the URL.
